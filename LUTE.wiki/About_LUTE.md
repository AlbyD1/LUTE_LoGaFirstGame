# Define: LUTE
LUTE is a tool based on [Unity](https://unity.com/), enabling creative individuals to design narrative-rich, location-based experiences easily. Its node-based structure facilitates quick integration of new mechanics and components, fostering unique and diverse experiences. LUTE aims to empower storytellers interested in crafting engaging narratives at historical sites and places of heritage. It's free, open-source, and dedicated to lowering the entry barrier to game development. If you're interested in creating educational historical experiences but lack game development or coding skills, consider using LUTE.

# Define: Target Audience
LUTE is currently geared towards Unity users familiar with game design, particularly those passionate about creating story-driven experiences. It's a great tool for crafting your first narrative-based game, with the added advantage of being able to leverage engineering knowledge to tweak it further. Think of it as a fully-fledged visual scripting engine, but without the complexity. In the future, we plan to expand the target audience to include those who may not be as technically proficient, ensuring that anyone interested in telling historical stories or creating engaging location-based games can do so easily.

# Define: Origins
LUTE originated from research within the [LogaCulture](https://logaculture.eu/) project. It draws inspiration from notable tools like Fungus, Twine, Inform, and Ren'Py. However, LUTE differs by emphasising locative and XR experiences, rather than solely focusing on narrative-based ones. Additionally, it provides support for integrating custom components, enabling the creation of unique games with added depth and complexity.

**LUTE is and always will be free and open source!**
