This page explains how to get LUTE setup within Unity.

# Installing LUTE Prerequisites:
1. Install the latest version of [Unity 3D](https://unity.com/download) for your chosen platform.
2. Open Unity via the Unity Hub and create a new project (either 2D or 3D will work depending on what style of experience you wish to create.
3. Allow the project to create and launch into Unity.

# Installing LUTE from GitHub releases:
As LUTE is currently not on the Asset Store (but will be soon!) you must download the latest release from our [GitHub page](https://github.com/IoIoToTM/LoGaCulture-Authorship-Tool/releases/latest).

You can then either import the package in two ways:

1. Ensure that your Unity project is open and then open the LUTE .unitypackage file from your file explorer. This will show you the import dialogue box in your Unity project - go ahead and import all assets.
2. Import LUTE into the new project by selecting Assets > Import Package > Custom Package. Ensure you choose the latest .unitypackage file you just downloaded and import all assets when prompted.

# Getting Started
1. Open the Flow Engine window by selecting LoGa>Show Engine Window. This will be where all your creations take place!
2. You should 'dock' the window for sake of clarity and convenience. Much like the other editor windows are docked, we reccomend docking it alongside the 'Console' window.

3. In the project window, navigate to the examples folder and open the 'Avebury Example' scene (LogaExamples>Avebury>AveburyExample.unity)
4. Play the game with the window open.

You can observe the tool window in real time whilst the game is playing... Have a look around and watch how the game is controlled using the Flow Engine. Try the other examples and have fun getting to know LUTE!

# Upgrading?
If you want to upgrade to the latest release or reinstall then:

1. Make a backup of your project if not using version control **(Please)**.
2. Update your Unity version if required.
3. Remove LUTE and examples from project if required.
4. Download and import latest version of LUTE.
5. Copy back your original project files if required.

Any troubles with updating then please let the team know on Discord/Issue Tracker.
