LUTE
======

Welcome to the community wiki for LUTE, the open source interactive story building tool for [Unity](https://unity.com/). LUTE is a free, open source tool for crafting engaging location-based narrative games within Unity that utilises other plugins for XR support. LUTE is designed to be easily mastered by those who are already somewhat familiar to Unity, particularly for folks with no coding background. More experienced game developers can take the system further by tweaking the engine under the hood as there is no aspect of this tool that is closed.

LUTE empowers you to create story-driven, location-based XR games focused on cultural heritage.

We offer a library of learning materials here which is currently being written.

A comprehensive list of pages is found to the right, and you can use the search function within this guide [here](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3AIoIoToTM%2FLoGaCulture-Authorship-Tool+&type=wikis).
